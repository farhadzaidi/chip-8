Registers
	- 8-bit general purpose registers (V0-VF)
	- 8-bit delay timer (DT) 
	- 8-bit sound timer (ST)
	- 16-bit program counter (PC)
	- 16-bit index register (I)
	- 16-bit stack pointer (SP)

Memory
	- 4 KB (4096 bytes)
	- 0x000-0x1FF is reserved for interpreter (ROM)
		- Fonts are stored at 0x000-0x04F
		- The frame buffer is stored at 0x050-0x14F
		- The stack is stored at 0x150-0x18F (32 levels)
	- 0x200-0xFFF is RAM
		- Programs (ROMS) are loaded in at 0x200
		- "ROMS" can modify themselves (since they are located in RAM)

Debugger
	- Set breakpoints (execute normally until breakpoint)
	- Step through instructions (one-by-one or specified amount)
		- Stop prematurely if wait instruction encountered
	- Show memory/registers and display after current instruction execution
	- Can step backward (one-by-one or specified amount)
		- Need to save memory at each instruction
	- Highlight memory/register changes after each instruction execution
	- Highlight:
		- ROM
		- Fonts
		- Stack
		- Frame Buffer
		- PC
		- SP
		- I
	(Maybe) Display instruction name and arguments at each
